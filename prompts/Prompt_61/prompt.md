# Prompt 61: Performance Monitoring & Optimization

Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization for production app:

## 1. Performance Monitoring
Create /src/services/performance.ts:
- App startup time tracking
- Screen load time monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Battery usage optimization

## 2. Bundle Analysis
Configure bundle analysis:
- Webpack bundle analyzer
- Metro bundle analysis
- Code splitting optimization
- Tree shaking verification
- Bundle size monitoring

## 3. Memory Management
Create /src/utils/memoryManager.ts:
- Memory leak detection
- Image memory optimization
- Component cleanup
- Cache size management
- Memory usage alerts

## 4. Network Optimization
Implement network optimization:
- Request batching
- Response caching
- Image optimization
- API compression
- Network usage monitoring

## 5. Rendering Optimization
Create /src/utils/renderingOptimizer.ts:
- Component memoization
- List virtualization
- Lazy loading
- Render optimization
- Animation performance

## 6. Performance Metrics
Track key metrics:
- First contentful paint
- Time to interactive
- App launch time
- Screen transition time
- User interaction response

## 7. Performance Testing
