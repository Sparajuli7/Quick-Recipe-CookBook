# Prompt 58: Testing Framework & Test Coverage

Implement comprehensive testing framework and test coverage for code quality:

## 1. Testing Setup
Create /src/tests/ folder structure:
- /unit: Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- /integration: Integration tests for services
- /components: Component testing
- /e2e: End-to-end testing
- /mocks: Test mocks and fixtures

## 2. Unit Testing
Create unit tests for:
- Utility functions and helpers
- Custom React hooks
- State management logic
- Validation schemas
- API service functions

## 3. Component Testing
Create component tests using:
- React Native Testing Library
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- Props validation tests
- Accessibility testing

## 4. Integration Testing
Create integration tests for:
- API service integration
- Database operations
- Authentication flow
- Payment processing
- Third-party service integration

## 5. E2E Testing
Create end-to-end tests using:
- Detox for mobile testing
- Playwright for web testing
- User journey testing
- Critical path testing
- Cross-platform testing

## 6. Test Utilities
Create /src/tests/utils/:
- Test data factories
- Mock service providers
- Test environment setup
- Custom testing helpers
- Test database setup

## 7. Test Configuration
Configure testing tools:
- Jest configuration
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance testing
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing

## 8. CI/CD Integration
Integrate testing with:
- Automated test runs
- Coverage thresholds
- Test result reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Quality gates

## âœ… Verify Success:
- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Coverage meets targets (80%+)
- [ ] E2E tests run on all platforms
- [ ] Performance tests pass
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline works
